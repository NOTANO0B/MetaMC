## Welcome to MetaMC
MetaMC will be the biggest datapack that ever comes to minecraft, with a planned size of 2-6 gigabytes! (we wanted to make it larger, but some people cant hold that much)
<br>The pack is mainly based on anarchy, so you will see a LOT the following:
<br>Guns
<br>RPGS
<br>Various Explosives
<br>Epic Gear!
<br>This datapack is currently being developed by github user NOTANO0B, or more commonly known as NOTANOOB#8711 on discord.
