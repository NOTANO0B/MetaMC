## Welcome to MetaMC
MetaMC will be the biggest datapack that ever comes to minecraft, with a planned size of 2-6 gigabytes! (we wanted to make it larger, but some people cant hold that much)
<br>The pack is mainly based on anarchy, so you will see a LOT the following:
<br>Cool Guns
<br>RPGS that actually blow stuff up
<br>Various Explosives
<br>Totally Awesome Gear!
<br>This datapack is currently being developed by github user NOTANO0B, or more commonly known as NOTANOOB#8711 on discord.
<br>AN EPIC TEXTURE PACK IS ALSO INCLUDED, THIRSTY YET?!

### Okay, I want this! HoW tO dOwNlOaD?!11

This datapack will be avaliable for download once we reach 50k USD

### OMG WTF Y U MAKE DIS SO EXPENSIIVE

Cuz I'm a human too
<br>On a more serious note, I am a student like most of the people here at the time of writing (year 2020), and I need money like everyone else. After I graduate, I'll need money for housing and cars and equipment and stuff like that, and I'll dedicate my life to computer programming, which means that I'll make more awesome stuff like this for the rest of my life. All of this needs funding, so yeah.
<br>If 50 thousand people each donate a dollar, then everyone could play this epic datapack for free. If each of these 50 thousand people tell their friends and family, every one will only have to donate 10 cents for unlimited access to the greatest datapack for minecraft. Most big youtubers have 1-50 million subs, if each subscriber gives even a cent, chances are the youtuber would have more money than this 50k, so it's really not that much.

### I WANNA DONATE!! WHERE COULD I?!

I'll leave a paypal link/embed in the short future. For now, just tell all your friends about this epic datapack!!

# MONEY $0/50,000
