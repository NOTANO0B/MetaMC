## Welcome to MetaMC
MetaMC will be the biggest datapack that ever comes to minecraft, with a planned size of 2-6 Gigabytes! This datpack is based on anarchy, so there'll be a lot of guns and stuff, for a(n) *almost* complete list please go [here](https://github.com/NOTANO0B/MetaMC/blob/master/planned-features.md).
<br> Although you could just read this, I reccommend you go [here](https://github.com/NOTANO0B/MetaMC/blob/master/old.md) to understand what's going on.
### Okie, so now you don't need monie from us, how the #### are you going to actually earn money?
Great question. I'm thinking of starting a youtube series where I showcase my updates, and I'll earn my money from good old MONETIZATION :D
<br> That means I'll no longer keep any logs on my updates, you could all view it on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJQxqjtVvZIQ6ERq4e3auug?view_as=subscriber).
### Then WHEN WE GET DA PACK
Depending on the popularity, I'll decide on a milestone.

### We have a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaMC/) by the way
